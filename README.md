### Synthetic Training Data Generator

You can use this project to create synthetic data for training an AI model. 

Currently, it is designed to capture training data for drunk people behaviour.

But you can import your animations that you have designed in blender or any other animation tool and plug it in this project. 

Once cameras are setup and the output folder paths added in the editor you are good to go.

Just click run and it will capture the data in png/jpg file format at 60 fps.
